Hi! My name is Daniel Pang.

I'm a senior Computer Science student with a minor in Business at the University of Waterloo. Born and raised in Toronto, Canada I found an interest in programming and photography at a young age.

Now, I am passionate about utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence to discover insights and building data processing applications.

You can find out what sort of problems I'm working on by checking out my <a class="page-link" href="https://github.com/danielpang/">GitHub</a> page.

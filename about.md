Hi! My name is Daniel Pang.

I write about what it is like to be a Christian in the tech industry. I am currently working as a Software Developer in Toronto. The views and opinions I express here are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my current or past employers.

You can find my personal blog <a class="page-link" href="https://medium.com/@dpang">here</a> where I talk about areas of technology I am interested in.

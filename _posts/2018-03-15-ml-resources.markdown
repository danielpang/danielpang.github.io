There has been an incredible growth of online machine learning resources in the past couple of years and while that has made learning ML more accessible, it has led to the problem of finding the right resource. The problem lies in the diversity of education backgrounds. Students who have a background in math/computer science, science, and engineering will find grasping ML concepts easier due to their background in mathematics and statistics.

While I have not gone through every single machine learning online course, I have done considerable research into finding one that suits my background and interests. I have often found that there was a tradeoff between theory intensive resources and pure application based resources. Some textbooks dive deep into the statistical mechanics behind each algorithm, while some online courses focus on how to use 3rd party machine learning APIs. While both cases are less ideal the latter does little to teach machine learning concepts, rather it teaches more of a plug-and-chug approach and does little to explain the how or why. Considering these things, here is the approach I use to choose data science/machine learning resources.

<h3>1. Prerequisite background knowledge </h3>
If you do not have the foundations of linear algebra, calculus, and computer programming it will make learning DS/ML significantly harder. Behind all the hype, machine learning is built on calculus, linear algebra, optimization, statistics, and computer science. A good place to start is <a class="page-link" href="https://github.com/ossu/data-science">https://github.com/ossu/data-science</a> which has a list of pre-req courses in mathematics and statistics.
<h3>2. Theory or application </h3>

Based on your current knowledge or goals from learning, you may have to make a tradeoff between theory and application. If you do not have a solid grasp of statistics then choosing a less theoretical resource may allow you to cover more breath than depth and allow you to move to application sooner.
<h3>3. Video or text </h3>

This depends on your learning habits, whether you learn better from video lectures or through reading text. This can only be determined by you through experience.
<h3>4. Assignments </h3>

Assignments are integral in reinforcing what youâ€™ve learned. It would be beneficial to use a resource that offers assignments.
<h3>5. Schedule </h3>

It is important to make sure you allocate enough time to learn and to choose a reasonable schedule to follow. Some online courses will have a weekly schedule that you can follow.
This article is not an absolute guide to finding the best machine learning resource, but the aim here is to find one that suits your knowledge and learning habits given your educational background. Happy learning! :)

(Note: I myself am a computer science student and I am still in the process of learning.)

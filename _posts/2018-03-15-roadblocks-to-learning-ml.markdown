The biggest roadblocks to learning data science and machine learning are understanding the hype surrounding it and how mathematics and statistics are the foundation of machine learning.

As exciting as machine learning, neural networks, big data or any other buzz word sounds, a large proportion of these techniques are not new. They have been around for some time but have only lately come up in the news due to their use in modern day application. While these algorithms are very powerful they are not of much use without data to train on. It wasn’t until recently with the collection of data from online services that we have seen the full potential of these algorithms and hence their popularity.

After getting around the hype, a common roadblock to students is the amount of mathematics and statistics that show up in data science. Unfortunately I’ve seen too many courses or programs that offer to teach anyone data science without going through calculus, linear algebra, or statistics first. The issue is not only do these topics show up in implementations of common methods of ML but these topics teach a mathematical intuition and thinking to why things are a certain way in data science. Mathematical concepts such as calculus and optimization explain how and why costs functions are minimized. Overlooking these fundamental concepts will often result in poor understanding of data science.

While data science and machine learning are fun to learn and is an emerging field of growth, it does not come without hard work and time.
